Whereas children who were born to the most-educated women are gaining resources, in terms of parents' time and money, those who were born to the least-educated women are losing resources. The forces behind these changes include feminism, new birth control technologies, changes in labor market opportunities, and welfare-state policies. I contend that Americans should be concerned about the growing disparity in parental resources and that the government can do more to close the gap between rich and poor children.},

Results were largely consistent with theory. Parents' use of inductive as opposed to power-assertive discipline was related to children's prosocial behavior. Children of inductive parents were more empathic; and more empathic children were more prosocial. Moreover, children's empathy was found to mediate the relation between parents' discipline and children's prosocial behavior. Few relations were obtained for children's guilt indices, but post hoc analyses yielded theoretically consistent results. Contrary to expectations, parents' use of statements of disappointment was the component of the inductive discipline score which was most strongly related to children's prosocial behavior.},

In this essay, we discuss how these trends are changing the nature of father involvement and family life, and in turn affecting children's and fathers' developmental trajectories. We end with an eye toward the twenty-first century by examining how the children of today will construct their expectations about the roles of fathers and mothers as they become the parents of tomorrow. This life-span approach to fatherhood considers the broader sociohistorical context in which fatherhood develops, and emphasizes the urgent need to consider mothers, fathers, and family structure in future research as we seek to understand and model the effects of parenting on children's development.},

Additionally, adolescent GAD and SAD symptoms were stronger and more systematically related to psychological control than to behavioral control. With regard to age\textendash{}sex differences, anxiety symptoms almost systematically predicted parental control over time for the early adolescent boys, whereas no significant differences were found between the late adolescent boys and girls.},

  abstract = {Contemporary theories have generally focused on the behavioral, cognitive, or emotional dimensions of prosocial moral development. In this volume, the author brings these 3 dimensions together while providing the first comprehensive account of prosocial moral development in children. The main concept is empathy\textemdash{}one feels what is appropriate for another person's situation, not one's own. The author discusses empathy's role in 5 moral situations. The book's focus is empathy's contribution to altruism and compassion for others in physical, physical psychological, or economic distress; feelings of guilt over harming someone; feelings of anger at others who do harm; feelings of injustice when when others do not receive their due. Also highlighted are the psychological processes involved in empathy's interaction with certain parental behaviors that foster moral internalization in children and the psychological processes involved in empathy's relation to abstract moral principles such as caring and distributive justice. This important book is the culmination of 3 decades of study and research by a leading figure in the area of child and development psychology.

Emotions are vital to effective parenting. When invested in the interests of children, emotions organize sensitive, responsive parenting. Emotions undermine parenting, however, when they are too weak, too strong, or poorly matched to childrearing tasks. In harmonious relationships, emotions are, on average, positive because parents manage interactions so that children's and parents' concerns are promoted. In distressed relationships, chronic negative emotion is both a cause and a consequence of interactions that undermine parents' concerns and children's development.

  abstract = {In the present research on parenting and adolescent behavior, there is much focus on reciprocal, bidirectional, and transactional processes, but parenting-style research still adheres to a unidirectional perspective in which parents affect youth behavior but are unaffected by it. In addition, many of the most cited parenting-style studies have used measures of parental behavioral control that are questionable because they include measures of parental knowledge. The goals of this study were to determine whether including knowledge items might have affected results of past studies and to test the unidirectional assumption. Data were from 978 adolescents participating in a longitudinal study. Parenting-style and adolescent adjustment measures at 2 time points were used, with a 2-year interval between time points. A variety of internal and external adjustment measures were used. Results showed that including knowledge items in measures of parental behavioral control elevated links between behavioral control and adjustment. Thus, the results and conclusions of many of the most highly cited studies are likely to have been stronger than if the measures had focused strictly on parental behavior. In addition, adolescent adjustment predicted changes in authoritative and neglectful parenting styles more robustly than these styles predicted changes in adolescent adjustment. Adolescent adjustment also predicted changes in authoritativeness more robustly than authoritativeness predicted changes in adjustment. Thus, parenting style cannot be seen as independent of the adolescent. In summary, both the theoretical premises of parenting-style research and the prior findings should be revisited.},

These data, together with the failure of studies directed exclusively to parent effects on children, have led to a reformulation of socialization theory to encompass the reciprocal influences of parent and offspring. The cognitive capabilities, knowledge, and attitudes of parents assume a more important role in this theory. New research approaches are now available that can isolate parent and child effects, thus providing the foundation needed for identifying reciprocal influences. If research fills in the outline of this new perspective, and the viewpoint is communicated to parents, it should facilitate parent\textendash{}child interaction. Previous theories, all too often given extreme expression in the mass media, have adversely affected the functioning of parents, either causing them to feel too much responsibility for their children's development, or leading them to mistake permissiveness for parental involvement and commitment. The reformulation should attenuate these extreme formulations, because neither of the latter is consistent with the concept of reciprocal influences. (9 ref)},

Other issues worthy of careful consideration are the context of father involvement, processes used to index involvement, and dimensions of involvement. In addition to examining father involvement from a developmental perspective, future research needs to study father involvement within a greater variety of ethnic-minority groups so that both cross-group and within-group variability can be appreciated.

In the third section the authors examine fathers' responses to parenthood and to their infants, the processes by which infants become attached to their parents, and differences in the nature and impact of mother- and father-child relationships. Changes in the nature of relationships between children and their parents in childhood and adolescence are discussed in the final substantive section. Here, they describe the mechanisms by which parent-child relationships are gradually transformed over this period and the roles that fathers play in the lives and socialization of their adolescent sons and daughters. Throughout the chapter they discuss both normative issues and the factors that distinguish individual parent-child relationships from one another.

  abstract = {Objective Fathers are increasingly involved in care of their babies and young children. We assessed the association of resident fathers' involvement with subsequent behaviour of their children, examining boys and girls separately.   Methods We used longitudinal data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study for children born in 2000\textendash{}2001, divided into three separate analysis periods: ages 9 months to 3 years, 3 to 5 years, and 5 to 7 years. By exploratory factor analysis of self-reported attitudes and engagement in caring activities, we derived composite measures of various types of father involvement at 9 months, 3 and 5 years. Where possible we created equivalent measures of mother involvement. Child behaviour was assessed by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which was completed by the mother when the child was aged 3, 5 and 7 years. We estimated gender-specific odds ratios for behaviour problems per quintile of father involvement, using separate logistic regression models for boys and girls in each analysis period. We controlled for a wide range of potential confounders: characteristics of the child (temperament and development at 9 months, and illness and exact age at outcome), equivalent mother involvement where appropriate, and factors related to socioeconomic status, household change, and parental well-being, where statistically significant.   Results Paternal positive parenting beliefs at age 9 months and increased frequency of creative play at age 5 years were significantly associated with lower risk of subsequent behaviour problems (SDQ total difficulties) in both boys and girls (p$<$0.05), odds ratios ranging between 0.81 and 0.89 per quintile of involvement. No associations were observed for other composite measures of caring activity by the father at 9 months, 3 years or 5 years.   Conclusion Quality of parenting, rather than the division of routine care between parents, was associated with child behavioural outcomes.},

This study examined reciprocal associations between father involvement in play and caregiving and children's adjustment and tested supportive coparenting behavior as a moderator of these associations. One hundred twelve families participated in a 1-year longitudinal study. Fathers reported on their involvement and mothers and teachers reported on preschoolers' behavior at two time points, and supportive coparenting behavior was observed at the second time point. Results showed that father involvement in play predicted relative decreases in externalizing behaviors, and also relative decreases in internalizing behaviors and relative increases in social competence at school only when accompanied by supportive coparenting behavior; reciprocally, fathers showed relative reductions in their play with children initially high in internalizing behaviors perceived by teachers. Father involvement in caregiving predicted relative increases in children's internalizing behaviors, but reciprocal effects indicated that these associations may be driven by children. The presence of reciprocal associations between father involvement and child behaviors that differed for play and caregiving domains and were moderated by supportive coparenting behavior suggests the importance of a transactional, domain-specific, and systemic approach to understanding father\textendash{}child relations and the implementation of relevant intervention practices.},

We also investigate the effects of policies on fathers' leave-taking and work hours. We find that taking leave and working shorter hours are related to fathers being more involved with the baby, and that policies affect both these aspects of fathers' employment behaviour. Thus, we conclude that policies that provide parental leave or shorter work hours could increase fathers' involvement with their young children.},

It used data from the first four waves of the UK's Millennium Cohort Study, when children (50.3 \% male) were aged 9 months, and 3, 5 and 7 years. The sample was 8302 families where both biological parents were co-resident across the four waves. Father involvement (participation in play and physical and educational activities with the child) was measured at ages 3, 5 and 7, as was child problem behaviour (assessed with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire). Key child and family covariates related to father involvement and child problem behaviour were controlled. Little evidence was found that more father involvement predicted less child problem behaviour two years later, with the exception of father involvement at child's age 5 having a significant, but small, effect on peer problems at age 7. There were two child effects. More hyperactive children at age 3 had more involved fathers at age 5, and children with more conduct problems at age 3 had more involved fathers at age 5. Child temperament did not moderate any child behaviour effects on father involvement. Thus, in young, intact UK families, child adjustment appears to predict, rather than be predicted by, father involvement in early childhood. When children showed more problematic behaviours, fathers did not become less involved. In fact, early hyperactivity and conduct problems in children seemed to elicit more involvement from fathers. At school age, father involvement appeared to affect children's social adjustment rather than vice versa.},

It also offers an innovative gender comparison of relative time spent in (1) the activities that constitute child care, (2) child care as double activity, and (3) time with children in sole charge. These measures give a fuller picture of total time commitment to children and how men and women spend that time than has been available in previous time use analyses. The results indicate that compared to fathering, mothering involves not only more overall time commitment but more multitasking, more physical labor, a more rigid timetable, more time alone with children, and more overall responsibility for managing care.

Fatherhood has always been a multifaceted concept, although over time the dominant or defining motif has shifted in turn from moral guidance to breadwinning to sex-role modeling, marital support, and finally nurturance. As a result of these changing concepts, the extent of father involvement has been viewed and indexed in different ways at different times. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when societal concerns about the effects of fatherlessness were coming to the fore, social scientists also became much more interested in quantification of concepts such as father involvement, motivated in part by the emergence and popularity of time-use methodologies. This prompted a shift from a focus on qualitative dimensions (such as masculinity and dominance) to quantifiable dimensions (the amount of time spent by fathers with their children). This led to a restricted focus on paternal nurturance with little if any attention paid to the other functions or aspects of fatherhood. The narrowly focused view of fatherhood that resulted, ignored subcultural variation in the definition and understanding of fatherhood. Social scientists are only now beginning to seek a broader and more inclusive understanding of fatherhood-efforts that should permit more insightful research on the effects of variations in performance of the relevant roles.},

A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

Behavioral genetic analyses showed that children who resided with antisocial fathers received a "double whammy" of genetic and environmental risk for conduct problems.

We assessed whether associations among family relationships, parenting stress, and child outcomes were different in the 2 household types.
METHODS: Parental and child characteristics were matched for 95 female same-sex parent and 95 different-sex parent households with children 6 to 17 years old. One parent per household was interviewed by telephone. Multivariate analyses of variance and multiple linear regressions were conducted.
RESULTS: No differences were observed between household types on family relationships or any child outcomes. Same-sex parent households scored higher on parenting stress (95\% confidence interval = 2.03-2.30) than different-sex parent households (95\% confidence interval = 1.76-2.03), p = .006. No significant interactions between household type and family relationships or household type and parenting stress were found for any child outcomes.
CONCLUSION: Children with female same-sex parents and different-sex parents demonstrated no differences in outcomes, despite female same-sex parents reporting more parenting stress. Future studies may reveal the sources of this parenting stress.},

We examine differences in mothering and fathering behavior in singleparent households, where number of parents is held constant, and we describe individualist and structuralist perspectives for potential sex-based parenting behaviors. We compare 3,202 single mothers and 307 single fathers in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten Cohort). Results suggest that, although there are small differences in the parenting behaviors of single mothers and single fathers, differences are sensitive to demographic disparities and do not translate to academic deficits for children in either family type.},

  abstract = {Most studies investigating the role of parenting behavior in the intergenerational transmission of anxiety from parents to children have focused on mothers. However, recent research suggests that mothers and fathers may parent differently and may differentially affect the development of child anxiety. Theoretical models propose that anxious parents engage in more anxiety-provoking and less anxiety-reducing parenting behavior than non-anxious parents. However, findings are inconsistent, possibly because most studies have not differentiated between anxiety disorders. Therefore, it remains unclear which specific anxiety disorders are linked to parenting behavior. This study examined (1) whether symptoms of specific parental anxiety disorders are linked to overinvolvement and challenging parenting behavior towards infants; and (2) the differential relationship of maternal/paternal overinvolvement and challenging parenting behavior with infant anxiety. Parents of 81 infants (10\textendash{}15 months) completed the Overinvolvement and Challenging parenting behavior (CPB) scales of the Comprehensive Parenting Behavior Questionnaire, the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders-Adult version, and the Fear scale of the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised. Linear regressions showed that mothers' generalized anxiety disorder symptoms were associated with less CPB and more overinvolvement, whereas fathers' social anxiety disorder symptoms were associated with less CPB and more overinvolvement. Moreover, paternal, but not maternal, CPB was associated with less infant anxiety, and overinvolvement with more infant anxiety. Findings suggest that (1) different dimensions of paternal/maternal anxiety are linked to their parenting behavior; (2) maternal/paternal parenting behaviors are differentially associated with infant anxiety.},

Cross-reporter measures of all variables were created using mother and child report on questionnaires. Multiple regression analyses were used to test whether parenting predicted later temperament, controlling for prior levels of temperament and parenting, whether temperament predicted later parenting, controlling for prior levels of temperament and parenting, and whether temperament and parenting together accounted for subsequent adjustment problems. Child irritability predicted greater inconsistent discipline. Child fearfulness and positive emotionality predicted greater maternal acceptance. Maternal inconsistent discipline predicted greater fearfulness and irritability. The evidence suggests bidirectional relations between temperament and parenting such that inconsistent discipline may increase negative emotionality in children, and child irritability may evoke inconsistent discipline by parents. Fearfulness, irritability, acceptance, and inconsistent discipline demonstrated unique effects above all other temperament and parenting variables in predicting adjustment problems, suggesting that temperament and parenting are additive in their effects on child adjustment.},

G2 externalizing behavior mediated the relationship between G1 and G2 harsh parenting, while G2 academic attainment mediated the relationship between G1 and G2 positive parenting.

  abstract = {Most studies on early childhood parenting include only mothers. Fathers are rarely observed in interaction with their young children, although they play an important role in the socialization of their children. In this study, we observed parenting of mothers and fathers toward their sons and daughters in families with two children, using a within-family approach in a sample with systematically varying family constellations. Participants included 389 families with two children (1 and 3 years of age). Parenting practices were coded during free play using the Emotional Availability Scales (Biringen, 2008). Findings revealed that mothers showed higher levels of sensitivity and lower levels of intrusiveness toward their children than fathers. Furthermore, mothers and fathers were more sensitive and less intrusive toward their oldest child than toward their youngest child. Fathers' higher intrusiveness toward the youngest child was only found in the case of a youngest boy. Child gender was not related to parenting in any of the other analyses. Our results suggest that parent gender is more salient than child gender in the prediction of parenting practices in early childhood.},

  abstract = {We explore paternal social anxiety as a specific risk factor for childhood social anxiety in a rational optimization model. In the course of human evolution, fathers specialized in external protection (e.g., confronting the external world) while mothers specialized in internal protection (e.g., providing comfort and food). Thus, children may instinctively be more influenced by the information signaled by paternal versus maternal behavior with respect to potential external threats. As a result, if fathers exhibit social anxiety, children interpret it as a strong negative signal about the external social world and rationally adjust their beliefs, thus becoming stressed. Under the assumption that paternal signals on social threats are more influential, a rational cognitive inference leads children of socially anxious fathers to develop social anxiety, unlike children of socially anxious mothers. We show in the model that mothers cannot easily compensate for anxious paternal behavior, but choose to increase maternal care to maintain the child's wellbeing. We discuss research directions to test the proposed model as well as implications for the prevention and treatment of child social anxiety.},

We argue that this relationship can be better understood by examining the congruence between the post-child division of labor and pre-child expectation for the division of labor. Based on a met expectations framework, this idea was tested with 137 dual-earner heterosexual couples with young children. Hypotheses were testing using polynomial regression analyses with well-being considered in both affective (career, marital, and family satisfaction) and health-related (depressive and physical health symptoms) terms. Results suggested that congruence in the paid labor and childcare domain mattered most for wives' well-being, whereas congruence with household labor mattered most for husbands' well-being. Crossover analyses revealed a similar trend in that wives' expectations-division of paid labor congruence was significantly related to husband's well-being and husbands' expectations-division of household labor congruence was significantly related to wives' well-being. Hypotheses were also tested with pre-child desires for division of labor instead of pre-child expectations. The pattern of results was similar albeit stronger for expectations. Implications include the importance of comprehensively assessing division of labor and the fact that pre-child attitudes are relevant to post-child outcomes.},

The objective of this study was to test if emotion regulation mediates the association between mothers' parenting and adolescents' externalizing behaviour problems (conduct problems and hyperactivity). The parenting dimensions were warmth, psychological control and behavioural control (measured with knowledge, monitoring and discipline). Adjustment was made for contextual risk (measured with the number of proximal adverse life events experienced), gender, age and English as an additional language. Method? Data were from a UK community sample of adolescents aged 11?18 from a comprehensive school in a disadvantaged area. Results? At the multivariate level, none of the parenting variables predicted hyperactivity, which was associated only with difficulties in emotion regulation, contextual risk and English as a first language. The parenting variables predicting conduct problems at the multivariate level were warmth and knowledge. Knowledge did not predict emotion regulation. However, warmth predicted emotion regulation, which was negatively associated with conduct problems. Contextual risk was a significant predictor of both difficulties in emotion regulation and externalizing behaviour problems. Its effect on conduct problems was independent of parenting and was not via its association with difficulties in emotion regulation. Conclusions? The findings add to the evidence for the importance of maternal warmth and contextual risk for both regulated emotion and regulated behaviour. The small maternal control effects on both emotion regulation and externalizing behaviour could suggest the importance of paternal control for adolescent outcomes.},

In a sample of 518 families, adolescents (49 \% female; 83 \% European American, 16 \% African American, 1 \% other ethnic groups) reported on their mothers' and fathers' psychological control and knowledge about adolescents' whereabouts, friends, and activities at ages 13 and 16. Mothers and adolescents reported on adolescents' externalizing and internalizing behaviors at ages 12, 14, 15, and 17. Adolescents perceived their mothers as using more psychological control and having more knowledge than their fathers, but there was moderate concordance between adolescents' perceptions of their mothers and fathers. More parental psychological control predicted increases in boys' and girls' internalizing problems and girls' externalizing problems. More parental knowledge predicted decreases in boys' externalizing and internalizing problems. The perceived levels of behavior of mothers and fathers did not interact with one another in predicting adolescent adjustment. The results generalize across early and late adolescence and across mothers' and adolescents' reports of behavior problems. Autonomy-relevant mothering and fathering predict changes in behavior problems during early and late adolescence, but only autonomy-relevant fathering accounts for unique variance in adolescent behavior problems.},

Black children are of primary interest in the article because they experience disproportionate shares of the burden of poverty and economic loss and are at substantially higher risk than white children of experiencing attendant socioemotional problems. It is argued that (a) poverty and economic loss diminish the capacity for supportive, consistent, and involved parenting and render parents more vulnerable to the debilitating effects of negative life events, (b) a major mediator of the link between economic hardship and parenting behavior is psychological distress deriving from an excess of negative life events, undesirable chronic conditions, and the absence and disruption of marital bonds, (c) economic hardship adversely affects children's socioemotional functioning in part through its impact on the parent's behavior toward the child, and (d) father-child relations under conditions of economic hardship depend on the quality of relations between the mother and father. The extent to which psychological distress is a source of race differences in parenting behavior is considered. Finally, attention is given to the mechanisms by which parents' social networks reduce emotional strain, lessen the tendency toward punitive, coercive, and inconsistent parenting behavior, and, in turn, foster positive socioemotional development in economically deprived children.},

During visits to the children's preschools, observers watched for expressions of anger and sadness, and recorded the causes of the displays and the children's reactions. Mothers reported on their emotion socialization and discipline practices and their children's temperament. Although the children expressed more anger than sadness, they used more constructive reactions in response to sadness and more non-constructive reactions in response to anger. Maternal reports of appropriate family emotion were associated with low levels of non-constructive regulation responses to anger and sadness whereas reports of inconsistent parental discipline were generally associated with non-constructive regulation responses. All in all, the findings of this study are in accord with findings on middle-income children and indicate that low- and middle-income children are more alike than different with regard to the regulation of negative emotion in the peer environment.},

Students who reported having over-controlling parents reported significantly higher levels of depression and less satisfaction with life.

  abstract = {We examine how gender inequality in the family affects anger. A sociological model of distress predicts that conditions of inequality and disadvantage result in higher levels of all types of distress. However, most research on gender and parenthood has measured distress with depression and anxiety. Theoretically, anger results from perceptions of social inequality. Using data from a national probability sample of 2,031 adults, we find that women have higher levels of anger than men, that each additional child in the household increases anger, and that children increase anger more for mothers than for fathers. Parenthood introduces two types of objective stressors into an individual's life: economic strains and the strains associated with child care. Women are exposed to both types of strain more than men. Economic hardship, child-care responsibilities in the household, and difficulties arranging and paying for child care all significantly increase anger, and explain the effects of gender and parenthood on anger. In support of a gender inequality perspective, we find that mothers have the highest levels of anger because of economic inequality and the inequitable distribution of parental responsibilities. Mothers also are more likely to express their anger than others. However, expressiveness does not account for differences in anger between men and women or between parents and nonparents.},

  abstract = {This paper uses the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to examine children's involvement with their fathers in intact families as measured through time spent together. Our findings suggest that although mothers still shoulder the lion's share of the parenting, fathers' involvement relative to that of mothers appears to be on the increase. A ``new father'' role is emerging on weekends in intact families. Different determinants of fathers' involvement were found on weekdays and on weekends. Fathers' wages and work hours have a negative relationship with the time they spend with a child on weekdays, but not on weekends. Mothers' work hours have no effect on children's time with fathers. On weekends, Black fathers were found to be less involved and Latino fathers more involved with their children than are White fathers. The weekday-weekend differential suggests that a simple gender inequality theory is not sufficient in explaining the dynamics of household division of labor in today's American families.},

Results showed different combinations of variables predicted each behavioural outcome, and the child's `goodness of fit' in the home was a strong predictor of externalising behaviour and social skills. An interaction between temperamental inflexibility and punitive parenting in the development of parent-rated externalising behaviour problems was found. This study highlights the value of using specific indices of temperament, parenting and family functioning and of pursuing interaction effects in the prediction of children's behavioural development.},

Developmental patterns were found for some aspects of time involvement, with both mothers and fathers reporting higher involvement with younger adolescents. Ratings of time-spent were not associated with adolescents' self-reported emotional/behavioral problems. Both mothers and fathers agreed that mothers had more responsibility for adolescents' discipline, daily care, and recreational activities. Mothers and fathers reported comparable levels of satisfaction with this arrangement. Mothers, and to a lesser extent fathers, reported greater satisfaction with the division of labor when fathers showed higher levels of responsibility for adolescents' activities. Satisfaction with the division of labor was inversely related to interparental conflict. Few differences were found based on adolescent gender for any of these variables.

  title = {The Centrality of Control to Parenting and Its Effects},
  isbn = {978-1-4338-1240-8},
  abstract = {As this chapter, we hope, indicates, however, the distinctiveness of the control constructs does not center on an artificial polarization of thoughts and feelings in contrast with behavior. Indeed, it is hard to imagine that thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are ever disconnected. Rather, the constructs have been meant to clarify that parental control is injurious when it intrudes on or disrespects the psychological development of the child (e.g., self-development, identity, individuality) and that it is beneficial when it facilitates conformity to social or cultural expectations, which typically find expression in behavioral standards. This distinctiveness continues to be evidenced by the impact these differing types of control appear to have on children and youth. Although effects will never be unique\textemdash{}because the types of control are to some degree correlated, as are the types of outcomes\textemdash{}it appears clear that the prime impact of psychological control is disturbance in self-development and psychological functioning and that a principal effect of an absence of appropriate control is heightened deviance. As noted at the outset, the two forms of control are fully compatible with Baumrind's conceptualization of parental authority and control. These general findings relative to the effects of each type of control are also consistent with her empirical work, as demonstrated particularly in her most recent wave of results discussed in Chapter 1 of this volume and elsewhere (Baumrind et al., 2010).

DSEM is suitable for analyzing intensive longitudinal data where observations from multiple individuals are collected at many points in time. The modeling framework encompasses previously published DSEM models and is a comprehensive attempt to combine timeseries modeling with structural equation modeling. DSEM is estimated with Bayesian methods using the Markov chain Monte Carlo Gibbs sampler and the Metropolis\textendash{}Hastings sampler. We provide a detailed description of the estimation algorithm as implemented in the Mplus software package. DSEM can be used for longitudinal analysis of any duration and with any number of observations across time. Simulation studies are used to illustrate the framework and study the performance of the estimation method. Methods for evaluating model fit are also discussed.},

Thus, the current study investigated the relationships among parenting styles (e.g., authoritative, authoritarian, permissive), discipline strategies (e.g., non-violent discipline, psychological aggression, physical assault), and emerging adult emotional adjustment (e.g., self-esteem, depression, and anxiety). The sample consisted of 526 participants ranging in age from 18 to 22 years. Results were analyzed with structural equation modeling and suggest that, although perceived parenting styles and discipline are both correlated with emerging adult emotional adjustment, perceived parenting is associated with emerging adult emotional adjustment for females but not males when examined simultaneously with perceived discipline. This finding demonstrates the importance of examining the direct and indirect relationships in the context of gender dyads.},
